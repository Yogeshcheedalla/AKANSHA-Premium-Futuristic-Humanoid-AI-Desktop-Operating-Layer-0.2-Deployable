    "name": "constraint-driven-development",
    "description": "Establishes a project's quality bar as a written contract and stops agents quietly lowering it. Interviews the user on which dimensions matter, supplies sane default thresholds when they have no number in mind, records everything in CONSTRAINTS.md, and watches the diff for a weakened bar — new @ts-ignore or eslint-disable suppressions, skipped or deleted tests, assertions stripped out, unimplemented stubs, thresholds edited down. Use when no quality bar is written down, when the user says \"set up constraints\" or \"define our standards\", when the user wants dimensions they care about — accessibility, web performance, coverage — set up as enforced constraints, when an agent keeps silencing checks or skipping tests to get to green, when you need a coverage or performance threshold and don't know what number to pick, or when an agent writes more code than anyone will read."

    "name": "doubt-driven-development",
    "description": "Subjects every non-trivial decision to a fresh-context adversarial review before it stands. Use when you want every assumption cross-examined before proceeding, when stress-testing a plan for hidden failure modes, when correctness matters more than speed, when working in unfamiliar code, when stakes are high (production auth, security-sensitive logic, a high-stakes migration, irreversible operations), or any time a confident output would be cheaper to verify now than to debug later."

Achieves this through one-question-at-a-time interview until ~95% confidence about the underlying intent. Use when an ask is underspecified (\"build me X\" without \"for whom\" or \"why now\"), when the user explicitly invokes (\"interview me\", \"grill me\", \"are we sure?\", \"stress-test my thinking\"), or when you catch yourself silently filling in ambiguous requirements before any plan, spec, or code exists."
